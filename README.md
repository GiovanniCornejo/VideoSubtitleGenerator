# VideoSubtitleGenerator

## Description

VideoSubtitleGenerator is an open-source project for video analysis and automatic subtitle generation for YouTube videos. Unlike some other browsers, Firefox does not have support for this feature, so we are developing a web extension to fill that gap. Our extension will make it easy for users to generate and display subtitles for videos on the YouTube platform.

## Features

- Audio analysis engine for extracting spoken content.
- Speech recognition for generating subtitles.
- User-friendly interface for controlling subtitle settings.
- Compatible with the latest versions of Firefox.

## Installation

[Detailed installation instructions will be provided here once the project is ready for release.]
